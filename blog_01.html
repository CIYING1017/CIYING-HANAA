							<h1 class="major">Detailed process of setting up this website</h1>
							     <p>This website is built with github. I am a total starter of webpage designs, so although some steps might seem obvious and simple, it did took me some time to have some understandings of the basic setup of a webpage. Here is how I started the exploration. </p>
							     <p>1.Previously I've tried wix and wordpress, but neither of them could achieve the flexibility and customisation that I wanted.So I've decided to try github. Register Github and create a new repository named CIYING. Choose ‘add a README file’. </p>
							     <p>2. Click on ‘settings’ and change the ‘sources’ to ‘main’. In ‘Settings ‘-‘Pages’ I can choose a template and publish the website. Here the site name is https://ciying1017.github.io/CIYING/. </p>
							     <p>3. Log on to google domain and purchase the desired domain name. Here I bought www.ciyingwang.com. The price of 10 pounds/year is fair. Google domain also provides platforms where you can set up and edit your webpage. </p>
							     <p>4. In  I want to change the URL to www.ciyingwang.com but the DNS checking says </p>
							<!--          <span class="image fit"><img src="images/blog_01/Picture1.png" alt="" /></span>

							              <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/blog_01/Picture1.png" alt="" /></span>
									      <P> .</p>
									      <P> .</p>
									      <P> .</p>	    
							      	  
							     <p>5. Log on to google domain. In ‘DNS’ – ‘custom records’, type in the following </p>
							         <span class="image left"><img src="images/blog_01/Picture2.png" alt="" /></span>
							                      <P> .</p>
									      <P> .</p>
							                      <P> .</p>
							
							     <p>6. It will take a long time for the change to take place. Change URL in github-settings-pages again, and this message comes up </p>
							          <span class="image left"><img src="images/blog_01/Picture3.png" alt="" /></span>
							                      <P> .</p>
									      <P> .</p>
							                      <P> .</p>
									      <P> .</p>
							                      <P> .</p>
							     <p>7. According to the message I have to add another record on my google DNS. I don’t know what the difference is between ALIAS and CNAME, so I’ll just add A record. The IP addresses can be found on Github ‘manage custom domain’ documentation. </p>
							           <span class="image left"><img src="images/blog_01/Picture4.png" alt="" /></span>
							                      <P> .</p>
									      <P> .</p>
							                      <P> .</p>
							                      <P> .</p>
									      <P> .</p>
							                      <P> .</p>
							                      <P> .</p>
							
							     <p>8. When changing the URL in Github it still doesn’t work. It took about 30 min to propagate. Finally the URL is successfully changed to the desired domain.  </p>
							          <span class="image left"><img src="images/blog_01/Picture5.png" alt="" /></span>
							                      <P> .</p>
									      <P> .</p>
							                      <P> .</p>
							                      <P> .</p>
									      <P> .</p>
							                      <P> .</p>
							                      <P> .</p>
							                      <P> .</p>
							     <p>9. Then time to design the webpage. The style I wanted to achieve was like https://xiaohegithub.cn/ , which looks geeky and simplistic. What I don’t want to achieve is like https://html5up.net/massively, which looks cool but actually is a mess. </p>
							     <p>10. Before figuring out the detailed process of coding and setting up all the functions I wanted to have, I thought it would be more realistic if I made use of some existing templates first and then modified it.  </p>
							     <p>11. The webpage https://html5up.net/ provides some good template. I downloaded and unzipped one and loaded it onto my repository. </p>
							     <p>12. Go to index.html and change the codes inside. It’s pretty straightforward. </p>
							     <p>13.	When modifying the codes, I started to wonder how Github knows what language I am using. Apparently when editing the website I am using HTML language, but what if I add other files that are written in C++ or JavaScript? How will my repository recognise them and prevent them from collapsing?</p>
