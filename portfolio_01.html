							<h1 class="major">Portfolio for applying for MEng & Architecture at Bartlett (Uploaded: 25/06/21)</h1>
							     <p>Throughout the foundation year, I've been taking tutorials at Bartlett and preparing for my portfolio. The tutorials were once a week, which were quite useful but too few.There have been many projects that I wanted to try on, but my time was very limited and my ability to make models and use softwares was very insufficient. The result was good. I got accepted by both MEng and Architecture. Although having great spaces for improvement, this portfolio was what I finally produced in that year.</p>
